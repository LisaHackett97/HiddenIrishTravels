# [Hidden Irish Travels](xx)

![site-mockup](xxx)

Irish Hidden Travels is a site where users can share/view information/recommendations on places on the island of Ireland that others may not have heard of, but the user recommends visiting. Site was inspired by stories of friends and families about places they have accidently ‘found’, or discovered through word of mouth, while on day trips, or longer holidays around the island of Ireland.

The aim is to highlight and share information on places/things to do, that do not always appear on those “top10 places to visit lists” or get hidden way down the bottom of a google search. Site is aiming to encourage people living and visiting the Island of Ireland, to experience, discover and tell others about these places in a positive and helpful way.

## UX

### Site Owner goals

#### As site owner I want to

- Provide a place for users to recommend unusual and unknown places to see on the island of Ireland.
- Manage categories
- Update/add own personal recommendations
- Delete negative and misleading recommendations.
- Delete Users.

### Strategy and scope

The main goal of the site is to provide user with a site where they can find recommendations from others, on unusual or unknown places on the island of Ireland. Eg places the user may not have been aware. Users will not need to be registered to view the recommendations but will have to do so, in order to upload a review.<br>
To convert a visitor, and draw them in, there will be a short explanation of the site with some examples of unique and interesting places to visit.<br> Emphasis is on positivity on the site, this is a place for users to let others know about places they have perhaps stumbled that they have enjoyed and found interesting, but maybe had never heard of before.

### Structure of the website

The basic structure of the site is designed around making it easy for the user to navigate and view/upload recommendations. A user will land on the home page where they can view recommendations and use a simple process to register/login in order to manage their recommendations. Recommendation form will have 4 Fields for the user to update, 2 of which will be dropdown boxes. Username will be updated from the user profile.

Standard form will be used for new reviews/editing/deleting for all users and admin. Login and registration forms will be as simple and clear as possible to make it easy for the user to use the site
Admin user will also have a small form to find a user and option to delete.
Logout button will also be provided

#### Colors

I wanted to use green colour associate with Ireland so chose the hex value of the green on the irish flag. Use a dark colour for text, making it easily accessible and a light calming blue colour. All colours will be tested for accessibility/contrast/

Simple colour scheme containing 3 main colours:
	- 172a3a/169b62/edf6f9			
    | Irish green for small elements / A dark color for txt / light blue colour for overall visual |



![Final Colours Used](xx)

#### Typography

There will be two fonts used throughout the website. The titles font will be Hind, and the accompanying body font will be Poppins. Fallback fonts for both are san-serif
I feel these fonts are easy for user to read on screen and are visually appealing.
